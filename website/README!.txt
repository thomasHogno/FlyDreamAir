We use a Python module called Flask for development.
If you haven't installed Flask yet, run

pip install Flask

in a terminal. if there is an error make sure python and pip are up to date.

in app.py, change the value of variable 'demoFile' with the right directory, i.e. 'path\website\sensitiveData\users.json'

change directory to the website folder in terminal and run

python app.py

The website will load at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default. Use an incognito window to stop web caching from interfering. 

send me a message if something not working :)
